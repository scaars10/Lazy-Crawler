Director's Message
No doubt, over the years, the PEC has evolved to reach and hold an exclusive position in the technical education system in India. With a rich legacy of the past and its position as one ofthe best technical Universities in the world, I am glad that thecampus is progressing well.
Students admitted are meritorious and have zeal to excel inacademics. They must find time to participate in at least one co-curricular or sports activity to enhance their personality. Asmost of the students, faculty members and staff live on thecampus, we must have a family-like relationship.
We, the faculty members, must nurture our students to make them good human beings and worthy citizens of the country. Wealso have a rich Alumni base, who have done exceedingly well in nation building and we take pride in their achievements. Wemust therefore interact with them and call them here for their involvement in various activities at the campus.I invite the whole community to join hands with me to foster this institute.
Together, we can make a difference
